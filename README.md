> A command-line tool for social coding

Includes co-authors in commits when you collaborate on code. Use when pairing with a buddy or mobbing with your team.

## Install

git-mob is a CLI tool, so you'll need to install the package globally.

```
npm i -g git-mob
```

By default git-mob will use the `.gitmessage` template to append co-authors.

### Prepare commit msg setup

Do you want the co-authors appended to the message when using the command `git commit -m "commit message"`?

1. `git mob --installTemplate`
1. Add `prepare-commit-msg` to `.git/hooks` and see [hook-examples](https://github.com/findmypast-oss/git-mob/tree/master/hook-examples)
1. The hook will need to be executable `chmod +x prepare-commit-msg`

**More details about above ^**

`--installTemplate` This will create a file in your local `.git` folder where it will write the selected co-authors into.

`prepare-commit-msg` will need a script to read the co-authors template. See [hook-examples](https://github.com/findmypast-oss/git-mob/tree/master/hook-examples) folder for working scripts.

The command `git mob-print` will output to stdout the formatted co-authors which you can use in your own git hooks.

### Revert back to default setup

1. `git mob --uninstallTemplate`
1. Remove `prepare-commit-msg` file

## Workflow / Usage

With git-mob, the primary author will always be the primary user of the computer.
Set your author info in git if you haven't done so before.

```
$ git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
$ git config --global user.email "jane@example.com"
```

To keep track of potential co-authors, git-mob uses a JSON file called `~/.git-coauthors`.
Here's a template of its structure.

```
{
  "coauthors": {
    "<initials>": {
      "name": "<name>",
      "email": "<email>"
    }
  }
}
```

Start by adding a few co-authors that you work with.

```
$ cat <<-EOF > ~/.git-coauthors
{
  "coauthors": {
    "ad": {
      "name": "Amy Doe",
      "email": "amy@findmypast.com"
    },
    "bd": {
      "name": "Bob Doe",
      "email": "bob@findmypast.com"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

You're ready to create your mob. Tell git-mob you're pairing with Amy by using her initials.

```
$ git mob ad
Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Amy Doe <amy@example.com>
```

Commit like you normally would.
You should see `Co-authored-by: Amy Doe <amy@example.com>` appear at the end of the commit message.

Let's add Bob to the group to create a three-person mob.

```
$ git mob ad bd
Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Amy Doe <amy@example.com>
Bob Doe <bob@example.com>
```

Once you're done mobbing, switch back to developing solo.<sup>\*</sup>

```
$ git solo
Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

## More commands

### List all co-authors

Check which co-authors you have available in your `.git-coauthors` file.

```
$ git mob --list
jd Jane Doe jane@example.com
ad Amy Doe amy@example.com
bd Bob Doe bob@example.com
```

### Overwrite the main author

Overwrite the current author which could be useful for pairing on different machines

If the current author is: **Bob Doe**

```
$ git mob -o jd ad
jd Jane Doe jane@example.com
ad Amy Doe amy@example.com
```

Now the author has changed to **Jane Doe**.

### Add co-author

Add a new co-author to your `.git-coauthors` file.

```
$ git add-coauthor bb "Barry Butterworth" barry@butterworth.org
```

### Delete co-author

Delete a co-author from your `.git-coauthors` file.

```
$ git delete-coauthor bb
```

### Edit co-author

Edit a co-author's details in your `.git-coauthors` file.

```
$ git edit-coauthor bb --name="Barry Butterworth" --email="barry@butterworth.org"
$ git edit-coauthor bb --name="Barry Butterworth"
$ git edit-coauthor bb --email="barry@butterworth.org"
```

### Suggest co-authors base on current repo

Suggest some co-authors to add based on existing committers to your
current repo

```
$ git suggest-coauthors
```

### Add initials of current mob to your prompt

#### Bash

Add the initials to `PS1`, in `~/.bashrc`

```bash
function git_initials {
  local initials=$(git mob-print --initials)
  if [[ -n "${initials}" ]]; then
    echo " [${initials}]"
  fi
}

export PS1="\$(pwd)\$(git_initials) -> "
```

#### Fish

Add the following functions to `.config/fish/config.fish`

```fish
function git_initials --description 'Print the initials for who I am currently pairing with'
  set -lx initials (git mob-print --initials)
  if test -n "$initials"
    printf ' [%s]' $initials
  end
end

function fish_prompt
  printf "%s%s ->" (pwd) (git_initials)
end
```

<sup>\* [If you have git-duet installed, you'll need to uninstall it](https://github.com/findmypast-oss/git-mob/issues/2) since it conflicts with the git-solo command.</sup>
